# OICC Press

This is the OICC Press GitHub page where we are open sourcing some of the technical elements such as plugins used within our growing use of [OJS](https://github.com/pkp/ojs/)

OJS powers the main OICC Press website, with many custom elements you can find on this GitHub page in order to give our journals an improved experience of using OJS. Many of our plugins are licensed under MIT license and are provided as-is with no warranty, but you are free to use them on your journal's site.

We are also happy to accept contributions of any code patches or additional features added to our code.

Working in collaboration with [Invisible Dragon](https://invisibledragonltd.com).
